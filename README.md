#### Use official Node image

Official Node image contains `yarn` command now.

    docker:
      - image: node:10-alpine

          - run: yarn install
          - run: ci-yarn-upgrade --execute --verbose;
    workflows:
      version: 2
      scheculed-upgrade:
        triggers:
          - schedule:
              cron: "0 13 * * 3"
              filters:
                branches:
                  only:
